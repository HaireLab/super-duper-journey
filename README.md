The purpose of this repository is to share the preliminary results of a project examining change in vegetation between the time a set of field plots (n = 285) was first established in 1996 and when the plots were revisited in 2015. The field plots were located on five mountain ranges in the Madrean sky islands in Arizona, USA: Huachucas, Pinalenos, Santa Catalinas, Chiricahuas, and Santa Ritas.

Vegetation was measured in the field for six broad cover tyeps: "Broadleaf Evergreen Woodland", "mixed conifer Forest", "Conifer Woodland", "Ponderosa pine forest",  "Transition Forest" and "Grassland" 

 Initial goals of the analysis are:
1. Comparison stats and graphs of the distributions of basal area (BA) and trees per hectare (TPH) by cover type
2. Simple regression analysis using derived index of change for BA and TPH as response. Predictors will include fire history metrics, topography and climate
